    <h1>Alisha Li</h1>
    Currently I am studying Multivariate Statistics, Computer Systems, and Combinatorics and Graph Theory at Wellesley College.
    Last semester I took Linear Algebra and Probability and last summer I worked in <a href="https://www.freddynguyen.org/">Prof. Nguyen's</a> physician scientist group developing data piplines, visualizations, and query tests.
    I can often be found fencing, using <a href="/anki-heatmap">Anki</a>, or drinking tea.
